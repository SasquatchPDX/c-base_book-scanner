# Sprint001 Scanner Protocol Draft (v1)

## Core resources

- `ScanJob`: server-generated UUID, metadata hints, status, operator, scanner id.
- `ScanPage`: logical page identity and one or more immutable artifacts.
- `ScanTodo`: optional tasks like `RESCAN`.

## API surface (v1)

- `POST /scan/jobs/` -> create job
- `GET /scan/jobs/` -> list open jobs for scanner/operator
- `GET /scan/jobs/{job_id}/` -> detail
- `POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/pages/` -> upload page
- `PUT /scan/pages/{page_id}/` -> replace/reupload idempotently
- `POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/identify/` -> queue bibliographic lookup/review
- `GET /scan-identifications/{processing_job_id}/` -> lookup job status
- `POST /library/books/{book_id}/ocr/` -> request OCR from library variant
- `POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/ocr/` -> request OCR from scan pages
- `GET /ocr/{job_id}/` -> OCR job status/provenance
- `POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/finish/` -> queue identification when unlinked, otherwise finalize

## Page upload contract

- multipart form fields (`POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/pages/`):
  - `file` (required): the image; JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP or WebP. Anything Pillow cannot decode
    is rejected with 400 `invalid image`. The stored `mime_type` comes from the sniffed
    format, not the client `Content-Type`.
  - `logical_sequence_number` (required, integer >= 1)
  - `side` (optional): `left`, `right` or `single`, case-insensitive, aliases `l`/`r`/`s`.
    Missing means `single`. Any other value is a 400 (so a left+right pair can never
    silently collapse onto one page).
  - `checksum_sha256` (recommended): verified against the received bytes (400 on mismatch)
  - `capture_timestamp` (optional): ISO 8601 (naive means UTC), epoch seconds or epoch
    milliseconds (values above 1e11). A provided but unparseable value is a 400.
  - `scanner_metadata` (optional): JSON object string
- the client filename is sanitised (`Path(name).name`, unsafe characters replaced) and kept
  with its extension in the stored name; if it has no image extension one is derived from
  the sniffed format.
- idempotency:
  - repeated upload for the same `(job_id, sequence_number, side, checksum)` returns the
    existing version with HTTP 200 (`created: false`); a new version returns 201.
- job state: the first successful upload moves an `open` job to `capturing`.
- `PUT /scan/pages/{page_id}/` replaces a page. The body MUST be `multipart/form-data` with
  the same `file` / `checksum_sha256` / `capture_timestamp` / `scanner_metadata` fields.
  Replacing with an already-stored checksum re-activates that version (200).
- `POST .../pause/`, `.../resume/` and `.../cancel/` are idempotent (200 with the current
  state when already there) and return 400 if the job is in a state that cannot move
  (e.g. `finalizing`).
- `GET /scan/pages/{page_id}/image/` serves a downscaled (max 1600 px) JPEG of the active
  version with `ETag`/`Cache-Control`; originals are never streamed to browsers.

## Finish and raw pages

`POST /scan/jobs/{job_id}/finish/` (JSON or form body) finalizes a job linked to a book. By
default only pages with processed ScanTailor output are accepted. Raw scanner pages are
rejected with 400:

```json
{"error": "missing processed output for 2 page(s): ...",
 "missing_pages": ["<page uuid>", "<page uuid>"],
 "hint": "run ScanTailor stages or resend with allow_raw_pages=true"}
```

Send `{"allow_raw_pages": true}` to build from the raw uploads instead. A job with no linked
book queues bibliographic identification instead (202, `requires_bibliographic_review`).

## Client recipe (non-browser clients)

1. **Log in.** `GET /accounts/login/` and keep the `csrftoken` cookie. Then
   `POST /accounts/login/` as a form with `username`, `password` and
   `csrfmiddlewaretoken=<csrftoken cookie value>`, plus the header
   `Referer: <base url>/accounts/login/`. Success is a 302 and a `sessionid` cookie; keep
   the cookie jar for all later requests. Bad credentials return 401. Do not follow the
   redirect blindly if you only need the cookies.
2. **Every unsafe request** (POST, PUT) needs `X-CSRFToken: <current csrftoken cookie>` and
   a `Referer` header. Over HTTPS the Referer is mandatory and the origin must be listed in
   `BOOK_SCANNER_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, otherwise Django answers 403. The csrftoken cookie
   rotates at login, so re-read it after logging in.
3. Send `Accept: application/json`. Requests that do not ask for `text/html` get
   `401 {"error": "authentication required"}` when the session is missing or expired
   (browsers still get the login redirect). On a 401, log in again (step 1) and retry.
4. **Create a job:** `POST /scan/jobs/` (form or JSON: `provisional_title`, `scanner_id`,
   `book_id`, `expected_page_count`...). The response (201) contains the job `id`.
5. **Upload pages** one at a time with `POST /scan/jobs/{id}/pages/` as multipart, always
   sending `checksum_sha256` of the exact bytes. Retries are safe: re-sending the same
   `(sequence, side, checksum)` returns 200 without creating a version, so retry on network
   errors, timeouts and 5xx. A 4xx (other than 401) will not succeed on retry.
   Use `side=left|right` for spreads (same sequence number, two uploads) and `single`
   otherwise.
6. **Replace** a bad page with `PUT /scan/pages/{page_id}/` using a multipart body (not
   JSON, not raw bytes).
7. **Finish** with `POST /scan/jobs/{id}/finish/`, adding `"allow_raw_pages": true` if no
   ScanTailor processing has been run.

A runnable version of this flow is `scripts/scanner_client_example.py`.

## Storage and resilience

- Scanner sends raw image artifacts; server stores immutable upload.
- Replacements create new page version and mark previous version inactive.
- Source deletion by scanner is decoupled; pipeline policy handles source cleanup.

## Rescan todo flow

- `POST /scan/pages/{page_id}/rescan/` creates a new RESCAN todo for the page.
- `GET /scan/jobs/{job_id}/todos/` lists todos for a specific job.
- `GET /scan/todos/?state=...` lists or filters todos across jobs.
- `POST /scan/todos/{todo_id}/claim/` claims a todo.
- `POST /scan/todos/{todo_id}/complete/` marks a todo completed.
- `POST /scan/todos/{todo_id}/cancel/` cancels a todo.
- `GET /scan/jobs/?with_open_todos=true` lists jobs with open rescan todos.

## Security

- Upload endpoints require an authenticated session (401 JSON for API clients).
- Filenames are sanitized before storage.
- Parser/extractor boundaries remain server-side behind size and timeout controls.
